# apache-pig

<p>Apache Pig is a platform used for analyzing large data sets, using a high-level lenguage called Pig Latin, which has a large capacity of parallelization. At the moment, Pig's infrastructure layer consists of a compiler that produces sequences of Map-Reduce programs, for which large-scale parallel implementations already exist (the Hadoop subproject, for example).</p>

<p>It is important to explain that Apache Pig can be runned locally, but it is better to run it on a Hadoop Cluster, since its goal is the processing of very large data sets, which implicates on high processing times.</p>

<p>This repository at the moment <b>does not</b> contain explanations on how to set up and install the Apache Pig platform or the Hadoop Cluster. That will be made on future updates</p>
